# Conducting a Security Audit On Botium Toys


This project dives into a security audit of the fictional company Botium Toys. As part of this audit, I assessed their security controls and compliance posture, delving into critical areas like least privilege, disaster recovery plans, password policies, and more. This project not only highlighted the importance of implementing robust security measures but also underscored the significance of adhering to compliance standards such as PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC.
